# Crabbing_Up
"Crabbing Up" is a level-based 3D adventure game in low poly style, in which a crab named Barc must defeat various enemies after the death of his family, meet NPCs and scour the landscapes of Crablantis to defeat the ruler Caris in the end and avenge his family.

With different power-ups, the crab is modified both externally and internally, giving it different abilities.

Our different biomes feature unique enemies and an ever-changing atmosphere, guaranteeing the player an exciting and emotional gaming experience.

The name came from a pun of the phrase "crapping up" and the English word for crab ("crab"). Besides, the name was fitting, since the "Up" also symbolizes the path, that is, the levels that the crab ascends over time.
